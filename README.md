## How to use
To use the tests, you first need to get them on your PC. Download the repository from GitHub (if you don't know how to use git, you can just use the "Download ZIP"-Button on your right). Make sure you stay updated for changes! You can have access to my ownCloud that is synced with this repository, contact me if you're interested.
In the root directory there is a PDF (German) "Anleitung.pdf". It details how to set up everything in Eclipse. In other IDEs, it should work similar.
